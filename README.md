# hello-world
My hobby is oil painting, I want to enrich my artistic experience by approaching the creation of images by computer and my project is to make vinyl tables using a Graphtech FC3100-60 cutting table, using Inkut. But I'm 72 years old...

Hi all !
this is not a gag, I'm really 72 years old ... the proof: I discover the validation of the changes!
